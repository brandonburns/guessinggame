This game is a guessing game that revolves around tyring to 
guess what planet will show up.

It starts by giving vague hints, and each time that the user
fails, the hints become more specific. There are 5 hints, until 
eventually there is a loop that keeps prompting the player to 
guess, with no addtional help. 

When the player correctly guesses "Jupiter", the game ends and 
a picture of Jupiter shows up in the browser, confirming the 
victory. 

I am the sole source for this code, there was no collaboration, 
other than one instance of help from an instructor, on how to 
avoid the infinite loop I was initially creating.
